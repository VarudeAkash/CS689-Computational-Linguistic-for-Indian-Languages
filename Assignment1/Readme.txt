	I have created seperate notebook (.ipynb) files for each question. Hence There is not dependency between files

	All important details are thoroly mentioned in all notebooks and also in comments explaining about the code

	Counts that are being written by programs are stored in /frequencies folder

	Frequencies folder contains subfolders which are named by tokenizer used. These folders contains all required counts mentioned in assignment


Question1 ) Question1.ipynb:
		After Performing unicode correction, unicode corrected corpus is saved in '/corpus/Unicode_corrected_mr_100.txt

Question 2) Question2.ipynb:	
		Descending order of counts of unigram characters and syllables, bigram characters and syllables is stored in 'Frequencies/Question2' folder
		Everyting else is mentioned in question2.ipynb notebook

Question 3) 	Completed on website 

Question 4) Question4.ipynb:
			I have encorporated BPE, Unigram, Whiespace, mBERT tokanizers in this notebook. 
			You can select any one tokenizer at a time. (Instructions are mentioned in notebook itself)
			counts of unigram tokens, bigram tokens, syllables, characters are stored in folder named 'Frequencies/' in json format
		
	    Question4_indicBERT.ipynb:
			It is google collab notebook. An error occures while loading pretrained indicBERT model in localhost
			However, It gets successfully executed on google collab

Question 5) Question5.ipynb
			Run all cells to get performances (precision, recall, f1_score) by using different tokenizers

Question 6) Explained in pdf
